near-blank-project
==================

This app was initialized with [create-near-app]

**This is still a work in progress**

This game is a bit more complex than the solidity version. There is a factory contract that creates new instances of the rock paper scissors game. The main idea is just to learn some of the concepts of NEAR smart contract development like:

- how to do require or assert
- learn about env::*
- get a feeling of the near_sdk::collections
- testing single contracts (VMContext)
- **cross contract calls**

TODOs:
- create integration-tests with the simulation sdk (or maybe the workspaces?)
- test the contracts on .testnet
- create a better README
- web interface
